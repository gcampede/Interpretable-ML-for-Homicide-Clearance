These scripts refer to analysis at the national level, without state-wise distinction. 
To avoid processing data from the ground-up (gathering them from the MAP project website), 
you can navigate the following link to "Zenodo" (https://zenodo.org/record/6088039#.YgtlEPjSJhE)
and download the .pkl files allow to replicate  the analyses using the same train/test sets
employed in the study.  For the national-level models, the file are:

- USA_Xtrain_set.pkl
- USA_Xvalidation_set.pkl
- USA_Ytrain_set.pkl	
- USA_Yvalidation_set.pkl

To upload them directly, go to "pickle.dump" commands in the "US_grid_search_models.py" file.
