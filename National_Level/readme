These scripts refer to analysis at the national level, without state-wise distinction. To avoid processing data from the ground-up (gathering them from the MAP project website), the .pkl files allow to replicate the analyses using the same train/test sets used in the study. 
To upload them directly, go to "pickle.dump" commands in the "US_grid_search_models.py" file.
