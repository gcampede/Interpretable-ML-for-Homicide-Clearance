To avoid processing data from the ground-up  (gathering them from the MAP project website), the .pkl files allow to replicate the analyses using the same train/test sets used in the study. 
To upload them directly, go to "pickle.dump" commands in the "state_wise_prediction.py" file.

These scripts refer to analysis at the state-level.
To avoid processing data from the ground-up (gathering them from the MAP project website), 
you can navigate the following link to "Zenodo" (https://zenodo.org/record/6088039#.YgtlEPjSJhE)
and download the .pkl files allow to replicate  the analyses using the same train/test sets
employed in the study.  For the national-level models, the file are:

- stateSHAP_Xtest_sets.pkl
- stateSHAP_Xtrain_sets.pkl
- stateSHAP_Ytest_sets.pkl
- stateSHAP_Ytrain_sets.pkl


To upload them directly, go to "pickle.dump" commands in the "state_wise_prediction.py" file.
